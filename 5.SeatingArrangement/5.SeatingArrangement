We are making arrangements for a big sit-down party. There will be n tables
in the room, with m chairs around each table. The guests are numbered from 1
to mn, and weâ€™d like to choose a table for each of them so that two conditions are
satisfied. 

First, some guests like each other and want to sit together; accordingly,
we are given a set A of two-element subsets of {1, . . . , mn}, and, for every {i, j}
in A, guests i and j should sit at the same table. 

Second, some guests dislike each other and want to sit at different tables; 
accordingly, we are given a set B of two-element subsets of {1, . . . , mn}, and, 
for every {i, j} in B, guests i and j should sit at different tables.

Sample input may look as follows:

# const n =3.
# const m =4.

like (1 ,2; 2 ,3; 4 ,5; 5 ,6; 7 ,8; 8 ,9).
dislike (1 ,10; 1 ,11; 4 ,11; 4 ,12).
