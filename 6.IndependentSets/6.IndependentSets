A set S of vertices in a graph is independent if no two vertices from S are
adjacent. For instance, {B, D, E, G} is an independent set in the graph 

A ----- B
|\    / |
| E--F  |
| | /|  |
| |/ |  |
| H--G  |
|/    \ |
D-------C

Write a program in CLingo that finds independent sets of vertices of a
given size n.
