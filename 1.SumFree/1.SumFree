A set S of integers is called sum-free if there are no numbers x, y in S such that x + y is in S. For instance, {1, 3, 5} is sum-free, and {2, 3, 5} and {2, 4} are not.

Use Clingo to find a partition of the set described useing *member* predicate
into n sum-free subsets.

E.g. set of facts:

member(1).
member(3).
member(5).

captures set {1, 3, 5}.
