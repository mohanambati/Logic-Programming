DIRECTORIES:
* problemDescription 
  contains files that document benchmarks which assume to be the ones our team will experiment at first by hand to build expertise on modeling and rewriting
  Forexample 1.SumFree contains a text description of SumFree problem

* 1.SumFree directory
  contains two subfolders
  - encodings
      set of encodings that our team designed for a problem; they should be compatible 
      with the instances we have; 
      also ideally the encoding should be normalized. I.e., if the relations used in the encoding are the same in principle they should also share the same name.

  - instances
     set of instances that our team designed for a problem
 

* eventually there will be other directories as 1.SumFree for the other problems

* varios 
contains so far unsorted but related data: a place for team members to store intermediate results that in some form one day will make it to either encodings or instances.
